## Assumptions 🤔

* Create a Patient Referral Form according to the specifications provided using Material UI and Use Places Autocomplete. 
* Add Save and Delete buttons to the intake form instead of the expansional panel. Save button allows user to update their form prior to final submission making the form intiutive. 

## If I had more time ⏰:

* Dynamically render success and error messages. 
* Better form field and form submit validation. 
* Add 'Saving' spinner when user clicks save. 
* Use redux to manage state of data for app scalability.
